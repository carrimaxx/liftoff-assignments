## Submission Instructions

### Overview
When the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, colleges and universities across the world had to go virtual. This increased the demand for remote learning tools to help students keep track of their coursework. One tool we believe can help reduce the stress of learning virtually is an e-planner.


Our e-planner will help college students manage their coursework online. They will be able to add and view their classes on their personal accounts. Students will also be able to mark class and assignment due dates on their calendars and receive reminders. To help with structuring study time, students will have access to a Focus Zone where students will be able to use a Pomodoro Timer to help maintain focus during studying, as well as be able to track their study sessions. For daily affirmations, students can view and save inspirational quotes to their accounts.

We became inspired by the idea from Kaja’s Day Planner app and Andrea’s interest in an e-school app. As graduates of CoderGirls’ first fully virtual cohort, we all feel we could utilize this tool to manage our schedules. We hope this app can help students stay organized, focused, and motivated.
